1. Overview
===========

Blahcaml provides basic Ocaml bindings to the Blahtex library [1].
Blahtex is written in C++, and aims at the conversion of TeX equations
into MathML.  Blahtex was originally designed by David Harvey, but is
currently maintained by Gilles van Assche.

2. Facilities
=============

Presently, Blahcaml is composed of a single homonymous module.  The
module contains a basic function (named Blahcaml.unsafe_mathml_from_tex)
for performing an unsafe conversion of TeX into MathML, and three
functions that add some degree of safety to the conversion (by this
we mean that the generated MathML is checked for conformance against
the official MathML2 DTD).


3. Dependencies
===============

On the Ocaml side, Blahcaml depends on PXP.  PXP is used by the "safe"
functions for validating the generated MathML against the official
MathML2 DTD.

There is no need to get the Blahtex code because the Blahcaml tarball
ships with a snapshot of the relevant code from Blahtex.  This turned
out to be the most practical solution because presently the Blahtex
source has no provisions for building just the library and assumes that
developers will just copy the code into their own projects.

The Blahtex code is contained in the 'blahtexcore' and 'unicodeconverter'
directories, and except for the makefiles, is bundled in a pristine form.
The copyright of this code is of course that of the Blahtex authors.


4. Building and installing
==========================

Typing "make" should suffice to build the Blahtex code and the Blahcaml
bindings.  Note that the C++ portions require g++.  After building,
"make install" will perform a findlib installation.  To generate the
ocamldoc APIDOC, use "make apidoc".


5. License
==========

Blahcaml is licensed under the terms of the GPL version 2.  The Blahtex
portions bundled with the Blahcaml tarball are licensed in the same terms.
The tarball includes also the official MathML2 DTD from the W3C.  Check
the COPYRIGHT file in the 'mathml2dtd/mathml2dtd.d' directory for details.
