1. Overview
===========

Blahcaml provides basic Ocaml bindings to the Blahtex library [1].
Blahtex is written in C++, and aims at the conversion of TeX equations
into MathML.  Blahtex was originally designed by David Harvey, but is
currently maintained by Gilles van Assche.

2. Facilities
=============

Presently, Blahcaml is composed of a single homonymous module with only
one function.  This function, Blahcaml.unsafe_mathml_from_tex, takes as
input a UTF8 string containing an equation in TeX format, and returns
also a UTF8 string containing the same equation in MathML.  Note that
Blahtex makes no attempt at checking for malicious strings, and neither
does Blahcaml.  Hence the "unsafe" attached to the function name.
(Safe versions will be added in the future).


3. Dependencies
===============

On the Ocaml side, Blahcaml depends on ExtLib for the UTF8 module.
It is however trivial to recompile it to use the Camomile or Ocaml
Batteries version of the module.

There is no need to get the Blahtex code because the Blahcaml tarball
ships with a snapshot of the relevant code from Blahtex.  This turned
out to be the most practical solution because presently the Blahtex
source has no provisions for building just the library and assumes that
developers will just copy the code into their own projects.

The Blahtex code is contained in the 'blahtexcore' and 'unicodeconverter'
directories, and except for the makefiles, is bundled in a pristine form.
The copyright of this code is of course that of the Blahtex authors.


4. Building and installing
==========================

Typing "make" should suffice to build the Blahtex code and the Blahcaml
bindings.  Note that the C++ portions require g++.  After building,
"make install" will perform a findlib installation.


5. License
==========

Blahcaml is licensed under the terms of the GPL version 2.  The Blahtex
portions bundled with the Blahcaml tarball are licensed in the same terms.
