1. Overview
===========

Blahcaml provides basic Ocaml bindings to the Blahtex library [1].
Blahtex is written in C++, and aims at the conversion of TeX equations
into MathML.  Blahtex was originally designed by David Harvey, but is
currently maintained by Gilles van Assche.


2. Facilities
=============

Blahcaml is composed of a single homonymous module.  The module contains
facilities for performing both safe and unsafe conversions from TeX into
MathML.  Basically, an unsafe conversion simply invokes the underlying
Blahtex code, while a safe conversion adds a subsequent validation of
the generated MathML against the official MathML2 DTD [2].


3. Dependencies
===============

On the Ocaml side, Blahcaml depends on PXP [3].  PXP is used by the
"safe" functions for validating the generated MathML against the
official MathML2 DTD.

There is no need to get the Blahtex code because the Blahcaml tarball
ships with a snapshot of the relevant code from Blahtex.  This turned
out to be the most practical solution because presently the Blahtex
source has no provisions for building just the library and assumes that
developers will just copy the code into their own projects.

The Blahtex code is contained in the 'src/blahtexcore', 'src/unicodeconverter',
and 'src/messages' directories, and except for the makefiles, is bundled
in a pristine form.  The copyright of this code is of course that of the
Blahtex authors.


4. Building and installing
==========================

Typing "make" should suffice to build the Blahtex code and the Blahcaml
bindings.  Note that the C++ portions require g++.  After building,
"make install" will perform a findlib installation.  To generate the
ocamldoc API documentation, use "make apidoc".


5. License
==========

Blahcaml is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2.
See LICENSE file for full license text.  The Blahtex portions bundled
with the Blahcaml tarball are licensed in the same terms.  The tarball
includes also the official MathML2 DTD from the W3C.  Check the COPYRIGHT
file in the 'src/mathml2dtd/mathml2dtd.d' directory for details.
