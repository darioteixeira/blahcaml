(**	Initialises the MathML2DTD.  This must be done before any of the "safe"
	functions are invoked.  Note that this function is automatically called
	if the DTD has never been initialised and you invoke one of the "safe"
	functions, [sanitize_mathml] or [safe_mathml_from_tex].  Because the
	initialisation can take several seconds to complete, if you want
	predictability on the runtime performance of your application, you
	should invoke this function upon initialisation of your programme.

(**	Given a string containing potentially unsafe MathML, this function makes
	sure the it conforms to the MathML2 DTD.  If safe, the function returns
	the original string.  If, however, the string does not conform to the DTD,
	an exception is raised.  See the {{:http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/pxp.html}PXP
	documentation} for the meaning of these exceptions.  Note that if the DTD
	has never been initialised, this function will automatically do so upon
	its first invocation.  This operation can take several seconds to complete;
	therefore if you want predictability on the runtime performance of your
	application, invoke [init_dtd] upon initialisation of your programme.
